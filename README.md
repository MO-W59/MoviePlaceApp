# MoviePlaceApp
Small rudimentary and incomplete app to run a media rental store.

This program uses the JFrame class in Java to create a GUI for the user to input and load media from a file which contains XML tags to define the data to load into the various media subclasses. A few sample media files are created in the "Files" folder.

Still incomplete but the program shows some OOP, GUI, and file reading/writing concepts in Java.
